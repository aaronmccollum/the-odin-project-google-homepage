# Google Homepage Clone
This is a test project to clone the Google homepage, using VS Code to write HTML and CSS.  Additionally, I'm using Git to push changes from VS Code to Github for the first time.

### Skills learned:
- HTML structure and planning the page
- Basic styling with CSS
- Flexbox and moving div elements around the page
- Basic Git cloning, staging, and committing to Github
